## A solution for entrepreneurs

Fundrise was founded in 2010. But Ben and Dan Miller launched it realy in 2012. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundrise))
 
Initially they wanted to launch a real estate project in Washington DC. After enduring difficult and long negotiations with private equity investors, they turned to crowdfunding to finance their project. This enabled them also to include three major advantages that played a major role in the success of Fundrise.
 
<ul>
<li>First it <strong> cuts the oodles of red tape </strong> to get deals done. </li>

<li>Second, there are <strong> no middlemen </strong> and treat all investors equally.
</li>
<li>
Finally, this approach allows <strong> community residents to partake in their neighborhood development </strong>
</li>
</ul>

>[News Venture beat 2012](https://venturebeat.com/2012/08/19/fundrise-crowdfunding-for-real-estate-looks-like-the-real-deal/)
<P> 
Fundrise is based on public crowdfunding. Their initial project in 2012 they gathered 325,000$. But since then they launched several other crowdfunding projects, among which several for more than 50M $. But since 2015 they didn't had any crowdfunding anymore and launched the company as it is now.
</p>
 
## The disruptive Business behind Fundrise
 
<p>
Investments in real estate are often difficult for individuals due to two entry barriers: access to liquidity and plenty of paperwork. Creating Real Estate investment Trusts (REIT) allow all individuals to access investments in the private market. But most REIT investments are then also only available for accredited investors. Which doesn’t give the chance to non-accredited investors (less income) to invest in REIT.
</p>
 
 <P>
Fundrise announced an overall performance of 9,16% for its products after one year. This excellent performance shows the high return that can be offered. According to Ben Miller (founder of Fundrise) Fundrise is offering better performances than the general public market investments. Even Though there is a debate going on, Fundrise is indeed opening an investment market that wasn't easily accessible to any investors. 
</p>

> <em> "Private markets are inefficient – a product of their relative illiquidity, abundance of arbitrage opportunities, opacity, search costs, and fragmentation. In turn, private markets generate a typical pricing discount of at least 20-30%. We argue that by capitalizing on this spread – as institutional asset allocators have done for some time, and with remarkable success – investors can realize meaningfully superior returns on their portfolios."

 [Case study public vs. private market](https://fundrise.com/resources/cross-market-efficiency-gains) </em>
 
Fundrise aims to target all individuals that want to make investments, whatever the amount to inves, so even non-accredited investors. This opens new opportunities of investment to many people. Fundrise makes this possible with eREITs. It is the same principle as a REIT but every one can invest in them thanks to an online platform. As more people can start to invest in those products it brings new funds for real estate. With some hypothesis I tended to estimate the market sizing as followed :
 
| Market Sizing REIT| Population USA |Ready to invest | Invest in Private Market |Invest in Real Estate | Population investing REIT |Amount yearly |
| --- | ----------- | --- | ----------- | --- | ----------- | --- |
| People 0 - 20 | 80 000 000 pers | 5% | 50% |60% | 1 200 000 pers | 500 $ |
| People 20 - 40 | 80 000 000 pers |40% | 50% |60% | 9 600 000 pers | 2000 $ |
 People 40 - 60 | 80 000 000 pers |60% | 50% |60% | 14 400 000 pers | 4000 $ |
| People 60 - 80 | 80 000 000 pers |20% | 50% |60% | 4 800 000 pers | 4000 $ |
 
According to these figures Fundrise and its competitors could reach a market of 96,6 B$ investments funds. The current assets of Fundrise represent 1,5 B$. Whereas the total REIT market size in the USA was 16 T$ in 2018. ([Size REIT usa](https://www.reit.com/data-research/research/nareit-research/estimating-size-commercial-real-estate-market-us))

Based on this market size for REIT and the new accessible funds for companies as Fundrise we can conclude that the market is still young and has a lot of potential.
 
Compared to traditional Real Estate investors, Fundrise offers investment opportunities to accredited investors through eREIT. An eREIT is an electronic Real Estate investment Trust, in other words a share in a real property; Customers don't need a broker for the transactions as they can buy them on the Fundrise platform. ([definition eREIT](https://www.goodfinancialcents.com/fundrise-review-how-to-invest-in-corporate-real-estate-with-a-small-investment/)) <br>
The direct competitors of fundrise developed the more or less same strategy. The fees are often the biggest difference. But some competitors have nuanced differences concerning the investment strategy. For example : DiversyFund gives the possibility to invest in eREITs but only for properties that they acquire.
 

The technologies used for those solutions are mainly cloud solutions, data visualisation, google analytics and data analysis. Fundrise is using cloud platform services to provide an accessible platform to its customers. On this platform it provides a clear vision of their assets using data visualisation. Finally, before suggesting some investment projects it analyses its risk-return profile. This can happen with the use of big data to analyse the data related to the development project.

## Changes in the Landscape:
 
Fundrise was the first investment company in Real Estate products open to the public. 
 
Ten years ago only accredited investors could invest in large real estate projects. The rise of companies as Fundrise or Reality Mogul at the beginning of the previous decade, gave access to this market to all customers. It is mainly thanks to [digital access](https://fundrise.com/education/what-makes-fundrises-platform-unique) that this evolution has been possible. Customers have a personalized profile and can check in real time how their assets are doing. The middlemen are removed from the process which cuts costs and increases the net return. 
But the importance of social media to reach all kinds of customers is also not negligible. It is the number of customers that matters more than the amount invested for companies as Fundrise. 
 
Fundrise is obviously not the only one to taken adventage of the new opportunities. Since 2012 this market has also seen other investment companies that provide a similar service to Fundrise are : DiversyFund, Roofstock, Reality Mogul, ... The investement world in general is now more open to the public as ever before.

## Fundrise current position
 
Fundrise started in 2012 with a crowfunding of 325.000$. In only 9 years they transacted 5,1 B$. They have 115 achieved projects and 239 projects going on. This succes is due to a good performance of a couple of metrics.
 
Customers look at the investment net return per product as well as the stable evolution. Those two factors are thus important to get and keep customers' trust. Those factors are the main factors that come back on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FundRise/) to motivate customers choices. Another core metric for Fundrise are also the performances of public indexes, it is a central principle to do better than them. The idea is to convince public market investors to diversify their assets in order to invest in new private market assets.

Fundrise is currently the leader among the private market investment companies for accredited investors. Most sites on the web give the best rating to Fundrise in comparison to its competitors. Until now it remains the reference in this sector.
 
 
## What's next ?
 

Looking to the future, Fundrise could diversify its investements products. It is now accustomed to investment funds. Allowing investments to other private market products could be an appropriate next step.
 
My market sizing assumed that 60% of all individuals would invest in real estate. If we can increase this number, this would increase Fundrise market potential. It would also go along with Fundrise's current strategy, which is to give access to the private market to non-accredited investors. Private Equity, venture capital and hedge funds are other segments of the private market that could be targetted. I believe the prefered way would be to partner up with large investment funds. They don't have the expertise in "small investors'' funds, because they have accredited customers. It would be a way for them to sell products to new customers through the Fundrise platform.
 
Fundrise would then offer a quality control in the proposed investments, in a similar way as they do with real estate projects. As well as an excellent client service experience.
 
To make this possible, Fundrise would certainly need some exchange of information with the partnered entities. API programs could create the links between them. In addition to it, Fundrise should still keep a quality standard for those new investments and would require to analyse big data and implement machine learning algorithms to get the trends.
